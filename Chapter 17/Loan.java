 * (Restore objects from a file) The Loan class Listing 10.2 does not implement Serializable. 
 * Rewrite the Loan class to implement Serializable. Exercise17_07.java creates a file named Exercise17_07.dat 
 * containing Loan objects that were written using the ObjectOutputStream. 
 * Modify Exercise17_07 by adding a void function called outputData that reads the Loan objects 
 * from the file and displays the total loan amount. Suppose you donâ€™t know how many 
 * Loan objects are there in the file, use EOFException to end the loop.
